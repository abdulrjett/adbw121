      <p>A computer science student at city university of london.As a child, that greatly 
      adored drawing and painting, I was astonished by the ability to draw and erase at ease 
      and was intrigued to know how these machines worked. This interest never left me and has 
      only continued to increase my passion and curiosity towards the countless features 
      and uses that a computer beholds.</p>

    <p>
	My Year1 Java Milestone3 Project. This Java project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of multiple classes and objects . I created a game in which you have to collect
        a certain amount of coins while avoiding obstacles and proceed to a gate which will carry the player
        to level after level. You are also given options to pause and play the game as well as traverse to 
       other levels as well as stop or play then music.
